CC3000 WiFi Access Point SSID Scanning Example

This example requires a CC3000 WiFi BoosterPack attached to the
BoosterPack 2 connector of the EK-TM4C1294XL LaunchPad.  After booting and
initializing the CC3000, the application initiates a WiFi scan for access
points.  When the scan completes, the SSID, BSSID and security protocol
supported by each detected access point are output on the UART0 connection
available over the virtual COM port connection provided by the board's ICDI
debug interface.

To view output from the application, set your host system's serial terminal
to use 115200bps, 8-N-1.

The application may be rebuilt to support a CC3000 connected to the
board's BoosterPack 1 connector by replacing the label
``CC3000_USE_BOOSTERPACK2'' in the build environment with
``CC3000_USE_BOOSTERPACK1''.

For information on the CC3000 software stack and API, please consult the
