CC3000 Firmware Patch Programmer

This is the Patch Programmer tool for the CC3000 BoosterPack running on an
EK-TM4C1294XL LaunchPad.  Run the application to download new firmware
and driver patches to the CC3000 processor.  Status is output via UART0
which is available via the virtual COM port provided by the ICDI debug
interface.

Two patches are downloaded using this tool with the patch data is linked
directly into the application binary.  The driver patch can be found
in an array named ``wlan_drv_patch'' and the firmware patch can be found
in ``fw_patch''.  When new patches are available, these arrays must be
replaced with versions containing those new patches and then the
application rebuilt and run to apply the patches to the CC3000 hardware.

To view output from the application, set your host system's serial terminal
to use 115200bps, 8-N-1.

By default, the application is configured to expect the CC3000 BoosterPack
to be connected to the BoosterPack 2 connector on EK-TM4C1294XL. It may,
however, be rebuilt to support a CC3000 connected to the board's
BoosterPack 1 connector by replacing the label ``CC3000_USE_BOOSTERPACK2''
in the build environment with ``CC3000_USE_BOOSTERPACK1''.
